ZZ
==

This is a basic Ubuntu box I have configured with some utilities I commonly
want but aren't in the base Ubuntu image.

Extras:

* ab
* curl
* telnet
* wget


Why `zz`?
---------

1. It's very fast to type.
2. It's very rare. I've never seen anyone else use `zz`.
3. It shows up last alphabetically.
